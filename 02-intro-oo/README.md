# Object Orientation

## Questions
- Application of OO (functional / procedural programming)
- class names start with capital letters
    class User / Actor
- initialize method: we have to call it initialize b/c it's what ruby looks for 
- attr's & marcos... when to use additional methods instead of attr's? 
- initialize w/ or w/o arguments 
- when to use instance variables (Val - MeowCat) 

## What is OO
Runescape 
    User
    Runes
    Monsters
Facebook
    Users

Our classes are like blueprints

strings
intergers
arrays
hashes
booleans

stores info (properties)
execute behavior
we can access the properties and behavior via methods using . dot notation 



## Agenda

- creating a class
- intialize method
- instance variables (ie @name)
- attr macros 

- Teach our app what a `User` is
    - A `User` has a `name`
    - A `User` has an `age`
    - A `User` has `ss_number`
    - A `User` can change their `name`, `age`, and `ss_number`
    - A `User` should be able to say it's `name` and `age`
    - A `User`should not be able to show their `ss_number`
- A `User` can sign in, view, and edit their personal information
